The external applications system is designed to integrate with the internal functionality of **Gml Backend** and interact via **REST API**.

This allows external applications to automate the following processes:

* Creating, editing, and deleting game profiles
* Managing launcher builds and updates
* WebSocket integration
* Managing players
* Managing game servers
